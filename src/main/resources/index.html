    <h5>About this site:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The primary purpose of this site is to prevent you from locking yourself out of content in videogames.</li>
        <li>This is <em>not</em> a walkthrough. The guide items listed here tells you what you need to do (and more
            importantly, what you <em>must not do</em>) in order to progress through a quest, but not nescessarily
            <em>how</em> to go about doing those things.</li>
        <li>The guide is intended to be as spoiler-free as possible. If necessary, the guide items listed here may be
            slightly inaccurate in precisely what the triggers are for progressing or locking yourself out of a quest,
            if it means avoiding spoilers.</li>
        <li>This guide does not consider <em>names</em> of things to be spoilers, but it does consider description of
            things to be spoilers. The exception is if the name of the thing is also descriptive of the thing (for
            example, "Bob the Dragon", "Alice the fire maiden", and so on). The rule of thumb is that if the player is
            able to visualize the thing before encountering it, then that's too spoilery.</li>
